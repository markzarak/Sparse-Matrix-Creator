# Sparse-Matrix-Creator
A Spring Boot and Thymeleaf enabled application that takes a user's input to create, print, and display a sparse matrix array. On the server-side, the Compressed Sparse Row scheme is used to save storage space and speed up computations.

This application is an exercise in Java programming knowlegde, algorithms, and data structures.
